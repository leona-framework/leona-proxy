# Leona Framework - Proxying Capabilities

Welcome to the **Leona Framework** repository, focusing on the **leona-proxy** module. This repository is dedicated to providing advanced proxying functionality for classes, enabling you to achieve enhanced behavior and capabilities within your Spring MVC applications.

### Primary Features

The **leona-proxy** module offers powerful proxying capabilities that enrich the behavior of your beans. The primary features include:

- **AspectAware Annotation**:
  The `AspectAware` annotation empowers proxied beans with the awareness that they are being aspected or proxied. This awareness allows them to invoke their proxy methods internally, creating a seamless interaction between the original beans and their proxies.

- **ProxyProducer Annotation**:
  The `ProxyProducer` annotation introduces a dynamic mechanism for invoking Spring's AOP system. By annotating specific methods, you can trigger the creation of proxies on-demand, enhancing the adaptability and functionality of your application.

### Getting Started

The **leona-proxy** repository brings advanced proxying capabilities to the Leona Framework, enabling you to harness the power of proxy beans effectively. Whether you want to enhance bean behavior, create dynamic proxies, or streamline interactions, this module offers the tools you need to achieve your goals.

We encourage you to contribute, report issues, or suggest improvements. Your participation in the Leona Framework community is invaluable!
